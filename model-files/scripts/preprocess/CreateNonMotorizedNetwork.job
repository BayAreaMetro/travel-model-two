;
; TP+ script to create a non-motorized network, from which the distance can be skimmed.  For pedestrians, this 
; basically performs two tasks: 
;      (1) Take all of the one-way links in the network, and add the opposite direction for pedestrians.
;      (2) Drop all non-pedestrian links. This means include all non-highway road links and pedestrian paths.
; For bicycle, all non-highway road links as well as bike paths/trails are retained.
;
; In order to have the non-motorized skims bypass zone connectors on their shortest paths (except for the head and tail
; of the path), each zone connector is set to the max distance (cost) for the path it is associated with. When the skim
; is actually run (in NonMotorizedSkims.job) the max shortest-path cost is set to three times the allowed cost, and,
; with the network set as it is, only two zone connectors can be used (one at the beginning and on at the end), with
; the actual cost being shortest-path cost - 2*max cost.
;
; Input:  (1) A highway network containing the fields FT (functional type), BIKEPEDOK, CNTYPE (link type), and ONEWAY
;
; Output: (1) A pedestrian walk network, a pedestrian tap-tap walk network (with a different max distance from the former), 
;             and a bicycle network.
