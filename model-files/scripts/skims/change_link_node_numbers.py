    change_link_node_numbers.py in_link_file out_link_file node_mapping_file
    
    This is a simple script which uses an existing node mapping file to transfer a link
    file with a/b nodes in the first two entries to a/b in an updated numbering scheme.
    All columns subsequent to the first two are retained as the are currently written.

    inputs: in_link_file - the input link csv file, with columns (a_node,b_node,....)
            node_mapping_file - the location of the (csv) node mapping file, which has
                                columns (new_node,old_node), and no header

    outputs: out_link_file - the output (csv) file, which looks exactly like the input, only
                             with updated node numbers
