# Outputs
Most outputs are stored within the *project directory* under "ctramp_output", "skims", "trn", and "other" folders, each with its respective files.  

## Skims

TM2 produces multiple types of network LOS indicators, often called skim matrices. The following skims are output and generated for each of the five time periods.

## CTRAMP Output

TM2 produces the following tour and trip microsimulation trip lists for both individual and joint travel. The files output are listed below. The modes are defined in [Tour and Trip Modes](#tour-and-trip-modes-codes) below.  

* Individual Tours - ctramp_output/indivTourData_[iteration].csv
* Individual Trips - ctramp_output/indivTripData_[iteration].csv
* Joint Tours â€“ ctramp_output/jointTourData_[iteration].csv
* Joint Trips - ctramp_output/jointTripData_[iteration].csv
* Resimulated Transit Trips - ctramp_output/indivTripDataResim_[iteration]_[inner_iteration].csv
* Unconstrained Parking Demand - ctramp_output/unconstrainedPNRDemand_[iteration]0.csv
* Constrained Parking Demand - ctramp_output/constrainedPNRDemand_[iteration]1.csv

It is important to consider occupancy when reviewing these tables. The model generates person trips. A mode is chosen for each person trip, for personal vehicle travel this could be SOV, HOV2, or HOV3+. At an aggregate level, 100 HOV2 person trips must result in 50 vehicle trips. While this is true at an aggregate level, it may not be possible to pair up all HOV2 person trips produced in the model. But the model produces enough HOV2 person trips to match the target mode share. When reviewing the joint table remember that these records include all travelers.  So only one row per trip, as opposed to one row per person or traveler.
