## Time Periods

Time periods in Travel Model Two are consistent with Travel Model One:

| **Time Period** | **Times** | **Duration** |
|-----------------|-----------|--------------|
| EA (early AM) | 3 am to 6 am | 3 hours |
| AM (AM peak period) | 6 am to 10 am | 4 hours |

## Roadway Network

The all streets highway network, walk network, and bicycle network were developed from [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/).  The *projection* is [**NAD 1983 StatePlane California VI FIPS 0406 Feet**](https://epsg.io/102646).

### County Node Numbering System

The highway network uses a numbering system whereby each county has a reserved block of nodes. Within each county’s block, nodes 1 through 9,999 are reserved for TAZs, 10,001 through 89,999 are for MAZs, and 90,001 through 99,999 for transit access points or TAPs. The blocks are assigned to the nine counties per MTC’s numbering scheme, as shown in the table below.

Roadway, walk, bicycle, and transit network nodes are numbered by county as well and range from 1,000,000 to 10,000,000 as shown below.

Code  | County | TAZs | MAZs |  TAPs | Network Node | HOV Lane Node
---|-------|-----|----|------|-------------|-------------

## Transit Network

The transit network is made up of three core components: transit lines, transit modes, and transit fares.  The transit lines were built GTFS feeds from raound 2015.  The lines are coded with a mode (see below) and serve a series of stop nodes.  Transit fares are coded according to Cube's Public Transport program (see below).

Transit trips are assigned between transit access points (TAPs), which represent individual or collections of transit stops for transit access/egress.  TAPs are essentially transit specific TAZs that are automatically coded based on the transit network.  See the [Level of Service Information](#level-of-service-information).

### Transit Modes

The following transit modes are defined based on the [Open511](https://511.org/developers/list/apis/) attributes (but not completely, since they came from the GTFS database predecessor, the Regional Transit Database).  These modes represent combinations of operators and technology.

### Transit Fares

Transit fares are modeled in Cube's Public Transport (PT) program as follows:
  1. Each transit mode is assigned a fare system in the Cube factor files
  1. Each fare system is defined in the fares.far fare file
  1. Each fare system is either FROMTO (fare zone based) or FLAT (initial + transfer in fare)
  1. For FROMTO fare systems:
    1. Each stop node is assigned a FAREZONE ID in the master network
    1. The fare is looked up from the fare matrix (fareMatrix.txt), which is a text file with the following columns: MATRIX ZONE_I ZONE_J VALUE
    1. The fare to transfer in from other modes is defined via the FAREFROMFS array (of modes) in the fares.far file
  1. For FLAT fare systems:
    1. The initial fare is defined via the IBOARDFARE in the fares.far file
    1. The fare to transfer in from other modes is defined via the FAREFROMFS array (of modes) in the fares.far file

## Truck Distribution

MTC uses a simple three-step (generation, distribution, and assignment) commercial vehicle model to generate estimates of four types of commercial vehicles. The four vehicle types are very small (two-axle, four-tire), small (two-axle, six-tire), medium (three-axle), and large or combination trucks (four-or-more-axle).

### Friction Factors

The trip distribution step uses a standard gravity model with a blended travel time impedance measure. This file sets the friction factors, which are vehicle type specific, using an ASCII fixed format text file with the following data:
 
 * Travel time in minutes (integer, starting in column 1, left justified);
 * Friction factors for very small trucks (integer, starting in column 9, left justified);
 * Friction factors for small trucks (integer, starting in column 17, left justified);
 * Friction factors for medium trucks (integer, starting in column 25, left justified); and,
 * Friction factors for large trucks (integer, starting in column 33, left justified).

### K-Factors

The trip distribution step also uses a matrix of K-factors to adjust the distribution results to better match observed data. This matrix contains a unit-less adjustment value; the higher the number, the more attractive the production/attraction pair.

## Fixed Demand

MTC uses representations of internal/external and air passenger demand that is year-, but not scenario-, specific -- meaning simple sketch methods are used to estimate this demand from past trends. This demand is then fixed for each forecast year and does not respond to changes in land use or the transport network.

### Internal/External

So-called internal/external demand is travel that either begins or ends in the nine county Bay Area. This demand is based on Census journey-to-work data and captures all passenger (i.e. non-commercial) vehicle demand. This demand is introduced to the model via a matrix that contains the following four demand tables in production-attraction format:

 * Daily single-occupant vehicle flows;
 * Daily two-occupant vehicle flows;
 * Daily three-or-more occupant vehicle flows; and,
 * Daily vehicle flows, which is the sum of the first three tables and not used by the travel model.

### Air Passenger

Air passenger demand is based on surveys of air passenger and captures demand from the following travel modes: passenger vehicles, rental cars, taxis, limousines, shared ride vans, hotel shuttles, and charter buses. This demand is introduced to the model via Main.TimePeriods specific matrices that contain the following six flow tables:

 * Single-occupant vehicles;
 * Two-occupant vehicles;
 * Three-occupant vehicles;
 * Single-occupant vehicles that are willing to pay a high-occupancy toll lane fee;
 * Two-occupant vehicles that are willing to pay a high-occupancy toll lane fee; and,
 * Three-occupant vehicles that are willing to pay a high-occupancy toll lane fee.
